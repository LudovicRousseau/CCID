INSTALLATION PROCEDURE
======================

Installation from source:
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

get the ccid-x.y.z.tar.gz archive and do:

$ tar xzvf ccid-x.y.z.tar.gz
$ cd ccid-x.y.z
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

By default pcscd and my ccid driver use /usr/local/pcsc/drivers/ as
directory for hotplug drivers. The ./configure script try to get the
directory used by pcscd using 'pkg-config libpcsclite --variable=usbdropdir'
So you should not have to use the --enable-usbdropdir=DIR argument.


libusb not found
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the ./configure script says something like:
  configure: error: usb.h not found, use --enable-libusb=PATH
You should use --enable-libusb=PATH to tell ./configure where to find
the usb.h and libusb.so files. The ./configure script will use
PATH/include/ to search for usb.h and PATH/lib/ to search for libusb.so


serial reader
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A serial CCID reader can also be connected on a serial port. By default
the serial driver is built but not installed. You must explicitely do:

$ ./configure --enable-twinserial
$ make -C src install_ccidtwin


builing serial reader only
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to generate the driver for the GemPC Twin using serial
communication only (for example on an embedded system without USB).
Just do:
$ ./configure --disable-libusb
$ cd src ; make libccidtwin.la ; sudo make install_ccidtwin

By default ./configure try to get the directory used by pcscd using
'pkg-config libpcsclite --variable=usbdropdir' and add '/serial'.
You should not have to use --enable-ccidtwindir=DIR to specify the
target directory to use. 


configuring the driver for the serial reader
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have to create or edit the file /etc/reader.conf. The file should
contain something like:

FRIENDLYNAME      "GemPC Twin"
DEVICENAME        /dev/ttyS0
LIBPATH           /usr/local/pcsc/drivers/serial/libccidtwin.so.0.4.2
CHANNELID         1

You may have to adapt the library path to your configuration and library
version.

If you use a GemPC PinPad, a GemCore POS Pro or a GemCore SIM Pro you
have to indicate it in the DEVICENAME field. You will then have
something like:
DEVICENAME        /dev/ttyS0:GemPCPinPad

If you use a recent pcsc-lite (1.2.9 or more)

  /dev/ttyS0 (DEVICENAME field) is the first serial port under Linux
  (known as COM1 under DOS/Windows). Of course if your reader is
  connected to another serial port you have to adapt that.


If you use an old pcsc-lite (1.2.0 or less)

  The reader is designated by CHANNELID. 1 is the first serial port
  (/dev/ttyS0 or COM1), etc.
  The driver uses the files /dev/pcsc/[1-4] to identify the serial
  device.  These /dev/pcsc/[1-4] files should be symbolic links to the
  real serial devices.

  To create the /dev/pcsc/[1-4] files do (as root):
  # mkdir /dev/pcsc
  # cd /dev/pcsc
  # ln -s ../ttyS0 /dev/pcsc/1
  # ln -s ../ttyS1 /dev/pcsc/2
  # ln -s ../ttyS2 /dev/pcsc/3
  # ln -s ../ttyS3 /dev/pcsc/4


Binary installation:
""""""""""""""""""""

Contact your distribution support.


Test procedure:
"""""""""""""""

- check the reader is supported by the driver.
  Get your reader USB identification using the lsusb(1) command:
  $ lsusb
  [...]
  Bus 001 Device 048: ID 08e6:4433 Gemplus

  Look for 08E6 (ifdVendorID) and 4433 (ifdProductID) in
  /usr/local/pcsc/drivers/ifd-ccid.bundle/Contents/Info.plist
  Of course your numbers will be different.

  If you can't find them add them (if you know what you do) and/or mail me.

- (re)start pcscd with debug on stdout. Simply do 'pcscd --debug stdout'
  (you will need to have root priviledges). And look for:
  [...]

  ccid_usb.c:223 Found Vendor/Product: 08E6/4433 (GemPC433 SL)
  ccid_usb.c:224 Using USB bus/device: 001/047

  If you don't see this the driver is not installed correctly or your
  reader is not yet supported. Read
  http://pcsclite.alioth.debian.org/ccid.html#CCID_compliant to know
  what to do.
