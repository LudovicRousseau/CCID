All platforms
    readers enumeration
    """""""""""""""""""
      You may have wrong reader identification if you connect two or
      more reader at the exact same time.

      The daemon pcscd and the CCID driver do not list connected readers
      in the same order. The driver has no way to know which reader has
      been detected as a new reader by pcscd.
      
      So if you plug two readers at the same time (for example if you
      start pcscd with two readers connected or if you plug a USB hub
      with two readers on the hub) you may have this (with two readers
      foo and bar):
      - pcscd scans the USB bus and finds a new CCID reader foo and
        calls the driver
      - the CCID driver scan the USB bus and finds a new different
        reader bar
      - pcscd continues scanning the USB bus and finds the second reader
        bar and calls the driver
      - the CCID driver scan the USB bus and finds an unused reader foo.

        Now the reader foo will be called bar by pcscd and bar will be
        called foo. This may not be a problem if the two readers have
        the same name. But it is strange to insert a card in the
        physical reader foo and see pcscd detect the card insertion in
        the reader he calls bar.
        
        The solution is to use IFDHCreateChannelByName() instead of
        IFDHCreateChannel() and specify the USB device to use. But pcscd
        does not implement IFDHCreateChannelByName() yet. Maybe in the
        future.
        
        Another solution is to plug readers one after the other and not
        at the same time.

*BSD
    libusb
    """"""
      The libusb does not yet support USB interrupt endpoints. You will
      notice that the driver will stop working as soon as you insert a
      card in the reader.
      A new version of libusb should fix this bug.

History:
========

0.4.1 - 14 February 2004, Ludovic Rousseau
    - distribute missing files readers/supported_readers.txt and
      src/create_Info_plist.pl
      'make install' failed because of this.

0.4.0 - 13 February 2004, Ludovic Rousseau
    - support of T=1 with TPDU readers. A lot of the T=1 code comes from
      Carlos Prados towitoko driver.
      My code is GNU GPL, his code is GNU LGPL so the global driver is
      GNU GPL
    - PPS negotiation if the reader does not do it automatically
    - add support for the Silitek SK-3105 keyboard. It's a USB device
      with multiple interfaces
    - use the create_Info_plist.pl script to generate the installed
      Info.plist from an Info.plist template and a list of supported
      readers. The Info.plist was too "complex" to maintain by hand
      since it now contains 11 entries
    - add support of IFDHCreateChannelByName to avoid wrong reader
      enumeration. This is not complete if you have multiple _identical_
      readers. You need to use a > 1.2.0 pcsc-lite version (not yet
      released at that time)
    - build but do not install the serial ccidtwin driver by default
      since it is useless on computers without a serial port or without
      this reader for example.
    - read and write timeouts are not symmetric. write timout can be
      shorter since the reader and card is not supposed to do anything
      before receiving (write) a command
    - do not try to find usb.h and other libusb files if
      --disable-libusb is used. Needed if you only want to build the
      serial driver.  Thanks to Niki Waibel for the patch
    - add a --enable-ccidtwindir argument to ./configure to specify the
      serial GemPC Twin installation directory
    - debug and code improvements and simplifications

0.3.2 - 4 November 2003, Ludovic Rousseau
    - src/commands.c: correct a stupid bug that occurs with an APDU with
      2 bytes response.
    - Info.plist: add SPR 532 in list of supported readers
    - parse.c: do not exit if the InterfaceClass is 0xFF (proprietary).
      It is the case with old readers manufactured before the final
      release of the CCID specs.
    - move LTC31 reader from unsupported to supported reader list. It
      was my f ault since in used odd INS byte in my test applet and odd
      INS bytes are forbidden by ISO 7816-4 ch. 5.4.2 Instruction byte.
      Thanks to Josep Moné s Teixidor for pointing the problem.
    - src/commands.c: comment out the automatic GET RESPONSE part. I
      don't think it should be in the driver. Maybe in pcscd instead?

0.3.1 - 23 September 2003, Ludovic Rouseau
    - add --enable-multi-thread (enabled by default) for thread safe
      support an APDU multiplexing. You will need pcsc-lite-1.2.0-rc3 or
      above to use this feature.
    - add --enable-libusb=PATH option is your libusb is not installed in
      /usr or /usr/local
    - honor DESTDIR in install rules (closes [ #300110 ]). Thanks to
      Ville Skyttä for the patch.
    - src/ccid.c: do not switch the GemPC Key and GemPC Twin in APDU
      mode since it also swicth in EMV mode and may not work with non
      EMV cards
    - src/ccid_serial.c: complete reimplementation of the Twin serial
      protocol using a finite state automata (code much simpler)

0.3.0 - 10 September 2003, Ludovic Rousseau
    - support of GemPC Twin connected to a serial port. Thanks to Niki
      W. Waibel for a working prototype.
    - support of auto voltage at power up if the reader support it
      instead of forcing a 5V in all cases.
    - support of APDU mode instead of just TPDU if the reader support
      it. Thanks to Jean-Luc Giraud for the idea and inspiration I got
      from his "concurrent" driver.
    - support of "time request" from the card.
    - parse: new indentation for more readability of supported features.
    - switch the GemPC Key and GemPC Twin in APDU mode since they
      support it but do not announce it in the dwFeatures.
    - new build process using autoconf/automake.

0.2.0 - 26 August 2003, Ludovic Rousseau
    - Works under MacOS X
    - Info.plist: use an <array></array> for the alias enumeration
    - Makefile rework for *BSD and MacOS X

0.1.0 - 13 August 2003, Ludovic Rousseau
    - First public release
