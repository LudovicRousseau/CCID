USB CCID IFD Handler
====================

  This package provides the source code for a generic USB CCID
(Chip/Smart Card Interface Devices) driver. See [1] for the USB CCID
specifications from the USB working group.


Authors:
========

- Ludovic Rousseau <ludovic.rousseau@free.fr>
- Carlos Prados for the PPS and ATR parsing code (taken from his
  towitoto driver) in towitoko/ directory.
- Olaf Kirch for the T=1 TPDU code (from the OpenCT package) in openct/
  directory. I (Ludovic Rousseau) greatly improved this code.

=======================

(in alphabetical order)
- ActivCard USB reader 3.0
- Advanced Card Systems ACR 38U-CCID [16]

  special USB frame is sent from the reader. If the frame size if a
  multiple of wMaxPacketSize the communication is stopped.
- Alcor Micro AU9520 [46]
  Firmware 1.01 is bogus. The time request sent by the card is not
  forwarded by the reader to the host.

Unsupported or partly supported CCID readers:
=============================================

- ActivCard USB reader 2.0 [10]
    The reader do timeout when a special USB frame is sent from the
    reader. If the frame size if a multiple of wMaxPacketSize the
    communication is stopped.
- C3PO LTC31 (old model, USB product id 0x0003) [8]
    The reader works fine with Linux kernel 2.4 but does not with Linux
    kernel 2.6. The ioctl() syscall returns EINVAL (Invalid argument)
- iDream (THRC2002-2) [47]
    PPS fails with a Cryptoflex card
    powerup fails with a Setcos card
    does work with the belgium eID (the reader is sold for this
    application)
- Kobil mIDentity [22]
    Time requests are not managed correctly and make the firmware fails.
    This is not a problem unless you use a time-consuming APDU like RSA
    key generation.
    A new firmware will correct the bug.


Supported operating systems:
============================

- GNU/Linux (libusb 0.1.7)
- MacOS X/Darwin (libusb 0.1.8beta, CVS snapshot. See "Known problems")
  to libusb)


Debug informations:
===================

The driver uses the debug function provided by pcscd. So if pcscd sends
its debug to stderr (pcscd --foreground) then the CCID will also send
its debug to stderr. If pcscd sends its debug to syslog (by default)
then the CCID will also send its debug to syslog.

You can change the debug level using the Info.plist configuration file.
The Info.plist is installed, by default, in
/usr/local/pcsc/drivers/ifd-ccid.bundle/Contents/Info.plist

The debug level is set in the ifdLogLevel field. It is a binary OR
combinaison of 4 different levels.
- 1: critical: important error messages
- 2: info:     informative messages like what reader was detected
- 4: comm:     a dump of all the bytes exchanged between the host and the
               reader
- 8: periodic: periodic info when pcscd test if a card is present (every
               1/10 of a second)

By default the debug level is set to 3 (1 + 2) and correspond to the
critical and info levels.

You have to restart the driver so it read the configuration file again
and use the new debug level value.  To restart the driver you just need
to unplug all your CCID readers so the the driver is unloaded and then
replug your readers. You can also restart pcscd.


Known problems:
===============

MacOSX libusb
"""""""""""""
    There is a bug in libusb that crash the libusb library when you
    unplug a reader and replug it in another USB socket.  So if you
    unplug a reader replug it in the same USB socket.

    see http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=886778&group_id=1674&atid=101674

      password also displayed on the token screen
    - contrib/Kobil_mIDentity_switch: tool to activate the CCID reader
      of the Kobil mIDentity. The tool should be started automatically
      by the udev rule on Linux
    - GemPC pinpad: localisation of the string "PIN blocked", add
      Portuguese(pt), Dutch(nl) and Turkish(tr) localisations
    - some minor bugs removed

    - pcscd_ccid.rules: add non CCID generic (InterfaceClass: 0xFF)
      readers
    - INSTALL: document how to use --enable-udev on FreeBSD
    - move the O2Micro Oz7762 from the unsupported to the supported list
      since patches to support it are applied by default
      (O2MICRO_OZ776_PATCH)


1.2.0 - 19 January 2007, Ludovic Rousseau
    - add support for SCARD_ATTR_VENDOR_IFD_VERSION,
      SCARD_ATTR_VENDOR_NAME and SCARD_ATTR_MAXINPUT tags used by
      SCardGetAttrib(). Read SCARDGETATTRIB.txt for more documentation
    - add support for OmniKey CardMan 5125, CardMan 1021, C3PO LTC32,
      Teo by Xiring, HP USB Smartcard Reader
    - use --enable-twinserial to build the serial reader driver
    - use --enable-udev to configure for a use with Linux udev hotplug
      mechanism. This will allow pcscd to avoid polling the USB bus
      every 1 second
    - some minor bugs removed


1.1.0 - 11 August 2006, Ludovic Rousseau
    - support Extended APDU (up to 64KB) for readers in TPDU mode (many
      readers) or Extended APDU mode (very rare). This only works for
      T=1 cards.
    - add support for C3PO LTC31 (new version), OmniKey CardMan 3021, HP
      USB Smart Card Keyboard, Actividentity (ActiveCard) Activkey Sim,
      id3 Semiconductors CL1356D and CL1356T, Alcor Micro AU9520
    - support the contactless interface of the SCR331-DI-NTTCOM
    - add support of FreeBSD
    - increase the USB timeout used for PIN verify/modify to not timeout
      before the reader
    - the 4-bytes value returned by CM_IOCTL_GET_FEATURE_REQUEST shall
      be encoded in big endian as documented in PCSC v2 part 10 ch 2.2
      page 2. The applications using this feature shall be updated (to
      respect the PCSC specification).
    - use ./configure --enable-twinserial to compile and install the the
      driver for the GemPC Twin serial
    - some minor bugs removed


1.0.1 - 22 April 2006, Ludovic Rousseau
    - add support for Axalto Reflex USB v3, SCM Micro SDI 010, Winbond
      Electronics W81E381 chipset, Gemplus GemPC Card, Athena ASE IIIe
      KB USB, OmniKey CardMan 3621
    - support Solaris (Solaris uses a different libusb)
    - better documentation for ./configure arguments
    - improve support of Cherry XX44 keyboard for PIN verify and change
      (circumvent firmware bugs)
    - do not use LTPBundleFindValueWithKey() from pcscd since this
      function has been removed from pcscd API
    - use -fvisibility=hidden is available to limit the number of
      exported symbols


1.0.0 - 3 March 2006, Ludovic Rousseau
    - add support for ActivCard USB Reader 3.0, Athena ASE IIIe USB V2,
      SCM Micro SCR 355, SCR 3311, SCR 3320, SCR 3340 ExpressCard54,
      Gemplus GemCore SIM Pro, GemCore POS Pro (serial and USB), GemPC
      Express (ExpressCard/54 interface), SmartEpad (v 2.0), OmniKey
      CardMan 5121 
    - greatly improve support of PIN PAD readers. We now support TPDU
      readers with T=1 cards
    - use l10n strings for the Gemplus GemPC PIN PAD (it has a screen).
      Supported languages are: de, en, es, fr, it
    - rename ACS ACR 38 in ACR 38U-CCID since the ACR 38 is a different
      reader and is not CCID compatible
    - allow to select the Power On voltage using Info.plist instead of
      recompiling the source code
    - correct bugs in the support of multi-slots readers
    - if the card is faster than the reader (TA1=97 for example) we try
      to use a not-so-bad speed (corresponding to TA1=96, 95 or 94)
      instead of the default speed of TA1=11
    - the src/parse tool do not use the driver anymore. No need to
      update the Info.plist file first.
    - some minor bugs removed


0.9.4 - 27 November 2005, Ludovic Rousseau
    - add support for Eutron SIM Pocket Combo, Eutron CryptoIdentity,
      Verisign Secure Token and VeriSign Secure Storage Token, GemPC
      Card (PCMCIA), SCM SCR331-DI NTTCom, SCM Micro SCR 3310-NTTCom,
      Cherry ST-1044U, Cherry SmartTerminal ST-2XXX
    - add support of PC/SC v2 part 10 CM_IOCTL_GET_FEATURE_REQUEST add
      support of FEATURE_VERIFY_PIN_DIRECT and FEATURE_MODIFY_PIN_DIRECT
      remove support of IOCTL_SMARTCARD_VENDOR_VERIFY_PIN (now
      obsoleted). A sample code is available in examples/scardcontrol.c
    - we need pcsc-lite 1.2.9-beta9 since some structures used for PIN
      pad readers are defined by pcsc-lite
    - some (bogus) cards require an extra EGT but the ATR does not say
      so. We try to detect the bogus cards and set TC1=2
    - IFDHSetProtocolParameters(): only use a data rate supported by the
      reader in the PPS negociation, otherwise we stay at the default
      speed.
    - calculate and store the read timeout according to the card ATR
      instead of using a fixed value of 60 seconds
    - increase the read timeout if the card sends and WTX request
    - improve support of GemPC Twin and GemPC Card (serial protocol)
    - reset the device on close only if DRIVER_OPTION_RESET_ON_CLOSE is
      set. The problem was that a device reset also disconnects the
      keyboard on a keyboard + reader device.
    - use color logs
    - some minor bugs removed


0.9.3 - 14 March 2005, Ludovic Rousseau
    - change the licence from GNU GPL to GNU Lesser GPL (LGPL)
    - add support for ACS ACR 38, Kobil KAAN Base, Kobil KAAN Advanced,
      Kobil KAAN SIM III, Kobil KAAN mIDentity, SCM Micro SCR 331,
      SCM Micro SCR 331-DI, SCM Micro SCR 335, SCM Micro SCR 3310,
      SCM Micro SCR 532, Cherry XX44 readers
    - improve communication speed with readers featuring "Automatic PPS
      made by the CCID"
    - switch the Cherry xx33 reader in ISO mode if power up in EMV mode
      fails.
    - add support of character level readers. Thanks to O2Micro for the
      patch
    - add support for the O2Micro OZ776S reader but the reader firmware
      is still bogus
    - check firmware version to avoid firmwares with bugs. You can still
      use a bogus firmware by setting DRIVER_OPTION_USE_BOGUS_FIRMWARE
      in Info.plist
    - some minor bugs removed

0.9.2 - 15 August 2004, Ludovic Rousseau
    - T=1 TPDU code:
      . the work on T=1 TPDU code was possible thanks to Gemplus
        validation team who helped me test, debug and bring the code to
        an EMV validation level. Thanks to Jérôme, Jean-Yves, Xavier and
        the Gemplus readers department
      . error code was not checked correctly
      . avoid a (nearly) infinite loop when resynch are needed.
      . correctly initialise an internal value to allow more than one
        reader to work
    - multi-slots readers
      . add support for multi-slots readers. The only one I have is a
        SCM Micro SCR 331-DI with a contact and a contactless interface.
        The contactless interface may or may not work for you since the
        reader uses proprietary (undocumented) commands.
    - GemPC Twin serial reader
      . perform a command (get the reader firmware) to be sure a GemPC
        Twin (serial or pcmcia) reader is connected
      . use a dynamic timeout when reading the serial port.
        The first timeout used when detecting the reader is 2 seconds to
        not wait too long if no reader is connected. Later timeouts are
        set to 1 minute to allow long time APDU.
    - use `pkg-config libpcsclite --cflags` to locate the pcsc-lite
      header files
    - use `pkg-config --print-errors --atleast-version=1.2.9-beta5 libpcsclite`
      to test the pcsc-lite version
    - code improvements thanks to the splint tool (http://www.splint.org/)

0.9.1 - 1 July 2004, Ludovic Rousseau
    - I forgot to define IFD_PARITY_ERROR in a .h file

0.9.0 - 1 July 2004, Ludovic Rousseau
    - The T=1 TPDU automata from Carlos Prados' Towitoko driver is very
      limited and do not support error management mechanisms.
      I then used the T=1 TPDU automata from OpenCT (OpenSC project).
      This automata is much more powerful but still lacks a lot of error
      management code.
      I then added all the needed code to reach the quality level
      requested by the EMV standard.
    - add support for new readers:
      . Advanced Card Systems ACR 38
      . Cherry XX33
      . Dell keyboard SK-3106
      . Dell smart card reader keyboard
      . SCR 333
    - add support of multi procotol cards (T=0 and T=1)
    - the debug level is now dynamic and set in the Info.plist file (no
      need to recompile the driver any more)
    - add support for the libusb naming scheme: usb:%04x/%04x:libusb:%s
    - INSTALL: add a "configuring the driver for the serial reader
      (GemPC Twin)" part
    - use `pkg-config libpcsclite --variable=usbdropdir` so you do not
      have to use --enable-usbdropdir=DIR or --enable-ccidtwindir=DIR
      even if pcscd does not use the default /usr/local/pcsc/drivers
    - add support of IOCTL_SMARTCARD_VENDOR_IFD_EXCHANGE and
      IOCTL_SMARTCARD_VENDOR_VERIFY_PIN in IFDHControl()
    - read ifdDriverOptions from Info.plist to limit the use of
      IOCTL_SMARTCARD_VENDOR_IFD_EXCHANGE (idea from Peter Williams)
    - provide an example of use of SCardControl()
      IOCTL_SMARTCARD_VENDOR_IFD_EXCHANGE and
      IOCTL_SMARTCARD_VENDOR_VERIFY_PIN in example/
    - add a --enable-pcsclite option (default to yes) so that the driver
      can be compiled for a different framework (one needing
      tokenparser.l like Solaris)
    - Reset action is power off and power on, not just power on
    - use the include files from pcsc-lite
    - add a mechanism to allow power on at 1.8V, 3V and then 5V as
      specified by ISO 7816. We still use 5V for now to avoid problems
      with non ISO compliant cards

0.4.1 - 14 February 2004, Ludovic Rousseau
    - distribute missing files readers/supported_readers.txt and
      src/create_Info_plist.pl
      'make install' failed because of this.

0.4.0 - 13 February 2004, Ludovic Rousseau
    - support of T=1 with TPDU readers. A lot of the T=1 code comes from
      Carlos Prados towitoko driver.
      My code is GNU GPL, his code is GNU LGPL so the global driver is
      GNU GPL
    - PPS negotiation if the reader does not do it automatically
    - add support for the Silitek SK-3105 keyboard. It's a USB device
      with multiple interfaces
    - use the create_Info_plist.pl script to generate the installed
      Info.plist from an Info.plist template and a list of supported
      readers. The Info.plist was too "complex" to maintain by hand
      since it now contains 11 entries
    - add support of IFDHCreateChannelByName to avoid wrong reader
      enumeration. This is not complete if you have multiple _identical_
      readers. You need to use a > 1.2.0 pcsc-lite version (not yet
      released at that time)
    - build but do not install the serial ccidtwin driver by default
      since it is useless on computers without a serial port or without
      this reader for example.
    - read and write timeouts are not symmetric. write timout can be
      shorter since the reader and card is not supposed to do anything
      before receiving (write) a command
    - do not try to find usb.h and other libusb files if
      --disable-libusb is used. Needed if you only want to build the
      serial driver.  Thanks to Niki Waibel for the patch
    - add a --enable-ccidtwindir argument to ./configure to specify the
      serial GemPC Twin installation directory
    - debug and code improvements and simplifications

0.3.2 - 4 November 2003, Ludovic Rousseau
    - src/commands.c: correct a stupid bug that occurs with an APDU with
      2 bytes response.
    - Info.plist: add SPR 532 in list of supported readers
    - parse.c: do not exit if the InterfaceClass is 0xFF (proprietary).
      It is the case with old readers manufactured before the final
      release of the CCID specs.
    - move LTC31 reader from unsupported to supported reader list. It
      was my f ault since in used odd INS byte in my test applet and odd
      INS bytes are forbidden by ISO 7816-4 ch. 5.4.2 Instruction byte.
      Thanks to Josep Moné s Teixidor for pointing the problem.
    - src/commands.c: comment out the automatic GET RESPONSE part. I
      don't think it should be in the driver. Maybe in pcscd instead?

0.3.1 - 23 September 2003, Ludovic Rouseau
    - add --enable-multi-thread (enabled by default) for thread safe
      support an APDU multiplexing. You will need pcsc-lite-1.2.0-rc3 or
      above to use this feature.
    - add --enable-libusb=PATH option is your libusb is not installed in
      /usr or /usr/local
    - honor DESTDIR in install rules (closes [ #300110 ]). Thanks to
      Ville Skyttä for the patch.
    - src/ccid.c: do not switch the GemPC Key and GemPC Twin in APDU
      mode since it also swicth in EMV mode and may not work with non
      EMV cards
    - src/ccid_serial.c: complete reimplementation of the Twin serial
      protocol using a finite state automata (code much simpler)

0.3.0 - 10 September 2003, Ludovic Rousseau
    - support of GemPC Twin connected to a serial port. Thanks to Niki
      W. Waibel for a working prototype.
    - support of auto voltage at power up if the reader support it
      instead of forcing a 5V in all cases.
    - support of APDU mode instead of just TPDU if the reader support
      it. Thanks to Jean-Luc Giraud for the idea and inspiration I got
      from his "concurrent" driver.
    - support of "time request" from the card.
    - parse: new indentation for more readability of supported features.
    - switch the GemPC Key and GemPC Twin in APDU mode since they
      support it but do not announce it in the dwFeatures.
    - new build process using autoconf/automake.

0.2.0 - 26 August 2003, Ludovic Rousseau
    - Works under MacOS X
    - Info.plist: use an <array></array> for the alias enumeration
    - Makefile rework for *BSD and MacOS X

0.1.0 - 13 August 2003, Ludovic Rousseau
    - First public release
