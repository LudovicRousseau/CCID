The files buffer.[c|h], checksum.c and proto-t1.c comes from the OpenCT
project <http://www.opensc.org/>

I (Ludovic Rousseau) greatly patched proto-t1.c to add all the needed
code to reach the quality level requested by the EMV standard.

I (Stephan Baerwolf) slightly modified error-handling in "t1_transceive"
for "O2 Micro OZ776 CCID Smartcard Reader" devices (0b97:7772).
(There some "random?" usb timeouts cause operations to fail otherwise.)
